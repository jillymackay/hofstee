# Hofstee Standard Setting App


This repository contains the code for the [R(D)SVS Hofstee app](https://jill-mackay.shinyapps.io/HofsteeExample/), an app intended to explain how different criteria impact standard setting exam grades.

The original Hofstee standard setting code was developed by [Ian Handel](https://github.com/ianhandel) and shinified  by Jill as part of [the Quality Assurance for Teaching Data project](https://jillymackay.com/project/quality-assurance-of-teaching-data/)
